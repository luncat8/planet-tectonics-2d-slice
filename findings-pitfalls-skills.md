notes and pitfalls for LLM agents. write here if found good way to do something.

## scales (0.1.0 planning, see experiments/scale-check.js)

- do not mix the sim row mesh with the display transform. geometric graded rows
  (20 m -> 1000 km) distributed uniformly over screen pixels draw volcanos as needles
  (4:1+, measured) because the grading over-weights the top band. rows are a sim mesh;
  the display is `u = asinh(y / 40 km)` (smooth vertical log anchored at 0 m: linear in
  the crust band, log in the mantle) — a real 40 km x 4 km cone then lands at 17 x 16 px
  at the default window and stays square-ish at every band zoom.
- thin beds cannot live in rows (10 m beds at the center of the scale budget would need
  millions of rows). keep stratigraphy in Lagrangian column layer stacks and paint them
  through the display map: sharp at any zoom, zero advection smear.
- "volcano 10-30 px" is a screen statement: run the eruptive toy sim in screen-anchored
  cells (1 cell = 1 px at default zoom) so the edifice is literally 10-30 toy cells.
  square world cells are 9:2 bricks on the default pixel (2.34 km x 0.25 km) — avoid.
- two time sliders (10-100 kyr/frame geology, minutes-hours/frame lava) must couple only
  through a buffered quantity (chamber volume), never by scaling each other — otherwise
  fast geology turns eruptions into strobe lights.
