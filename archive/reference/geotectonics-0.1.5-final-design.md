# 0.1.5 — Final design: emergent plate tectonics and metallogeny on a static icosphere

Normative specification merged from the three 0.1 designs (see `0.1.5-compare.md` for the
reasoning and measurements). It is written to be implemented without the source documents.
Development plan: `0.2-plan.md`.

## 0. Requirements and constraints

From `0.0-draft.txt`, `0.0-draft-check.txt` and the follow-up constraints:

- emergent plates and plate boundaries; forces that move continents; mountains and trenches at
  collisions; plates can split; the planet cools and tectonics slows to a stop;
- concentrations from which ore deposits can be inferred (porphyry Cu, VMS, orogenic Au,
  placer Au, basin U / hydrocarbons, Fe as a proxy) without a periodic-table of layers;
- game realism, not research accuracy; GPU friendly; first prototype on the CPU in JS;
- resolution: **L5 (10,242 cells, ~223 km) on CPU; L6–L7 (41k–164k cells, 112–56 km) on GPU**;
- **time step 10k–100k years per frame** (dt = 0.01–0.1 Myr); a planet history is
  10^4–10^5 frames;
- runtime per `AGENTS.md`: file:// friendly, classic scripts, no build; CPU JS first, then
  WebGPU compute with the same pass structure.

Design consequence of the time step (measured, `experiments/advection-bench.js`): plate motion is
0.001–0.2 cell per frame. Any scheme that re-samples crust fields on the grid per frame
(semi-Lagrangian copy, upwind flux) either freezes, erodes the plate away, or smears a
coastline over 10–26 cells within one ocean crossing. Therefore **crust is never advected on
the grid**. Crust lives on Lagrangian columns that are moved by exact rigid rotations; the grid
is only the frame in which neighbours are found, boundaries are classified, topography and
erosion are computed and the planet is rendered.

## 1. Entities

### 1.1 Grid (static, from `js/geodesics.js`)

Icosahedral dual grid, V cells (12 pentagons). Used per cell: unit centre `r_i`, area `A_i`,
ring of ≤ 6 neighbours, edge length `len_ij`, centre distance `dist_ij`, tangent unit normal
`n_ij` (from i toward j, in the tangent plane of i), mean neighbour distance `d_i`, and the
equirectangular `lookup` table (initial cell guess and renderer). Everything else in
`Grid.build()` (bathymetry, `cellC`) is legacy from another project and is not used.

Reference cell area `A0 = 4πR²/V`. `R` is the planet radius (Earth default).

### 1.2 Plates (≤ 128 alive)

A plate is a rigid body on the sphere: `q` unit quaternion (body frame → world), `ω` angular
velocity vector (rad/Myr, world frame), inertia-like matrix `M = Σ A_i (I − r_i r_iᵀ)` over its
cells, id, parent, birth time. Plates are created at world start, by split events, and vanish
by merge events or when they lose their last column.

### 1.3 Columns (Lagrangian crust, capacity ≈ 1.5 V)

One column represents a crust column of nominal footprint `A0`. Persistent fields:

| field | unit | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `plate` | id | owning plate |
| `b` | unit vec3 | position in the plate's body frame — **never changes** while the plate exists |
| `hFel` | m | felsic (continental) crust thickness, ρ 2750 |
| `hMaf` | m | mafic (oceanic / underplated) crust thickness, ρ 2950 |
| `hSed` | m | sediment thickness, ρ 2400 |
| `age` | Myr | thermal age of the lithosphere (0 at a ridge) |
| `damage` | 0..1 | accumulated weakening (future rift) |
| `zDyn` | m | transient dynamic topography (trench, plume swell), relaxes to 0 |
| `fert` | 0.5..2 | provincial fertility multiplier, fixed at birth from seeded noise |
| `oArc oVms oMaf oOro oBas oPla` | 0..1 | ore potentials (§7) |

Scratch per frame: world position `w = q_plate · b`, `cell` (cached, hill-climbed), `consumedBy`.

Columns are created in gaps (§4.2), deleted in overlaps (§4.3), and otherwise persist. Within a
rigid plate their density is constant by construction, so no re-seeding or relaxation is needed.

### 1.4 Cell fields (Eulerian scratch and short memory)

`owner` (column index or −1), `ownerDist`, `plate`, velocity `v_i = R (ω × r_i)`, per edge
`relN_ij`, `relT_ij`, `type_ij` (memory for hysteresis), `polarity_ij`, `trenchDist`
(0, 1, 2 rings or more), `ext` (extension proxy), `z` (elevation), `wet`, `∇z`, mobile sediment
`m`, `mFel`, mobile placer `p`, `gap`, `spawnSlot`.

Only `type_ij` needs to survive between frames; everything else is recomputed. A save file is
therefore columns + plates + global scalars.

## 2. Frame pipeline

`dt` per frame is a user setting in [0.01, 0.1] Myr. All rates scale with `dt`; all events are
threshold-triggered, so results are `dt`-insensitive within the range. Every kernel reads the
previous state and writes only its own element; cross-entity transfers are done as
*mark* (writer marks its own record) + *gather* (receiver pulls from marked records), so
CPU and GPU give the same result and no atomics are needed in state paths.

| # | kernel | over | reads → writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| K0 | GLOBAL (CPU) | — | time, `Tm(t)`, plume positions; every ~1 Myr: split / merge / compaction / checkpoint (§5) |
| K1 | PLATES | plates | `q ← normalize(Δq(ω dt) · q)`; rotation matrices |
| K2 | MOVE | columns | `w = q_plate b`; `cell ← climb(cell, w)` (≤ 3 hill-climb iterations since motion < 0.4 cell) |
| K3 | BIN | cells | cell → column list (count, exclusive scan, scatter) |
| K4 | RASTER | cells | nearest column in cell ∪ ring by (distance, index) → `owner`, `ownerDist`, `plate`; `gap = ownerDist > rGap·d_i` |
| K5 | EDGES | cells | `v_i`; per edge `relN, relT` from the two plates' `ω`; `type` with hysteresis; subduction polarity; `trenchDist` (2-ring gather); `ext` from mantle flow |
| K6 | CONTACT | columns + cells | columns: find nearest opposing column within `rContact·d`, mark `consumedBy` if loser (§4.3); gap cells: spawn intent with donors (§4.2) |
| K7 | APPLY | columns, then cells | winners gather merged mass; donors give thinning share; arc cells' owners grow; consumed columns die; gap cells create columns at prefix-sum slots |
| K8 | COLUMN | columns | age, damage/heal, `zDyn` relax, plume effects, collapse diffusion of `hFel`, ore accumulation and saturation (§7) |
| K9 | SURFACE | cells (3 sub-passes) | (a) `z` from owner column by isostasy, `wet`, `∇z`; (b) erosion and downslope routing of `m, mFel, p`; (c) gather inflow, deposit into owner column, basin/placer ores |
| K10 | REDUCE | cells → plates | per-plate `M` and torque `b` (two-level reduction in fixed order); solve `ω_target = M⁻¹ b`; relax `ω` |
| K11 | DIAG | — | invariants, counters; async readback every N frames |

The renderer reads cell buffers (`z`, `wet`, `plate`, owner's ores) after K9.

## 3. Kinematics

### 3.1 Exact rigid motion

World position of a column is `w = q b` (quaternion rotation). Because `b` is constant and `q`
is renormalised every frame, 10^5 frames add no positional drift — the per-frame error is an
evaluation error, not an integrated one. Float32 `b` is sufficient (L7 cell = 56 km, f32 unit
vector resolution ≈ 0.4 m).

### 3.2 Locating and rasterising

`climb(c, w)`: from the cached cell, move to the neighbour with the larger dot product with `w`
until none is larger — exact on a Voronoi grid. Motion per frame < 0.4 cell so ≤ 3 steps.

Rasterisation: each cell takes the nearest column among the columns located in the cell and
its ring. Measured on this grid for rigidly moving columns: the nearest column is at
p50 0.37, p99.9 0.61, max 0.65 of `d_i`; the 1-ring union contains the disc of radius
≈ 0.85–1.0 `d_i`. So `rGap = 0.75` cleanly separates "covered" from "genuine gap", never
produces holes inside a plate, and never misses a column that is within the threshold.
Aliasing (7 % of cells with 2 columns, 7 % of cells with 0 but covered) is harmless: the
non-owner column is still tracked and still updated by column kernels.

### 3.3 Cell velocities and edge classification

`v_i = R (ω_plate(i) × r_i)`. For an edge between cells of different plates:

```
dv    = v_j − v_i                      (plate velocities evaluated at the two cell centres)
relN  = dv · n_ij                      < 0 convergent, > 0 divergent
relT  = dv · (r_i × n_ij)              shear
type  = CONVERGENT if relN < −ε_hi, DIVERGENT if relN > +ε_hi, else keep old type if |relN| > ε_lo, else TRANSFORM
```

`ε_hi = 2 mm/yr`, `ε_lo = 1 mm/yr` (hysteresis kills flicker). Edges inside one plate are
INTERIOR. Same-plate edges never carry deformation: a rigid plate deforms only through the
discrete events below.

Subduction polarity of a convergent edge (GPT/GLM rule, evaluated on the owner columns):

```
oceanic  = hFel < 8 km
both oceanic      → older age subducts
oceanic vs cont.  → oceanic subducts
both continental  → COLLISION (no subduction)
```

`trenchDist` = graph distance (0, 1, 2, ≥3) from a cell on the overriding plate to the nearest
subduction edge; arc cells are those with `trenchDist ∈ {1, 2}`.

## 4. Boundary processes (all local, all event-like)

### 4.1 Why events

Rigid plates cannot stretch or shorten. On the fixed grid, divergence shows up as **gaps**
(cells farther than `rGap·d` from any column) and convergence as **overlaps** (columns of
different plates closer than `rContact·d`, default 0.6). Each gap creates one column, each
overlap removes one. Because column density inside a plate is exactly conserved by rigid
motion, the rate of creation/removal automatically equals (relative speed × boundary length)
/ `A0`. A column penetrating a foreign plate is guaranteed to be caught within ~0.6–1.0 `d`
(any point is within 0.58 `d` of some cell centre), so overlap depth is bounded.

### 4.2 Gaps: spreading and rifting

A gap cell spawns a column at the cell centre. Plate = plate of the nearest column among ring
owners (ties by hash(cell, frame) → statistically symmetric spreading). Donors = the nearest
`K = 3` columns of that plate. The new column is:

- **oceanic** (`hMaf = hMafNew(Tm)`, `hFel = 0`, `hSed = 0`, `age = 0`, `oVms` set, §7) if the
  donors' mean `hFel` < `hRiftBreakup` (15 km);
- **rift** otherwise: takes `share = 1/(K+1)` of each donor's `hFel`, `hSed`, `oXxx` (mass
  conserved; donors thin). Its `age` = 0 (hot), `damage` = 0.6.

This yields the observed sequence without extra state: split → gap opens → margins thin from
35 km to 15 km over a few cells → rift valley (isostasy) → sea floods in → oceanic crust
starts → passive margins with thinned crust and sediment remain.

Spreading-rate proxy at a ridge cell = `relN` of the divergent edge; it scales `oVms` and,
on a hot planet, `hMafNew = 7 km · (1 + 1.5·max(0, Tm − 1))` (thick early oceanic crust).

### 4.3 Overlaps: subduction, collision, accretion

Each column looks (in its cell and ring bins) for the nearest column of another plate within
`rContact·d` that is closing in on it: `(v_other − v_self) · normalize(w_other − w_self) < −ε_hi`,
with `v` the two plates' velocities at the column positions. Using the pair's own relative
velocity instead of a cell-edge type makes the test independent of how the two columns fall
into cells. If the polarity rule says this column loses, it marks `consumedBy = winner`; the
winner gathers on the next pass. Outcomes:

| pair | loser | effect |
|---|---|---|
| O–O, O–C | oceanic (older) | **subduction**: column deleted; its `hMaf·A0` added to the *subducted* counter; its `hSed` and ores feed arc enrichment (§7); trench: `zDyn −= zTrench` on the winner's trench cells; overriding arc cells (`trenchDist 1–2`): `hFel += kArc · Tm · |relN| dt`, `hMaf += 0.3·kArc…` |
| C–C | thinner `hFel` (tie: smaller plate) | **collision**: winner gets `hFel += loser.hFel`, `hSed += loser.hSed`, ores averaged by mass; loser deleted. Convergence itself is throttled by the collision resistance force (§6.3), so consumption slows as crust thickens |
| any with `hSed` | — | 50 % of the loser's `hSed` is scraped onto the winner (accretionary prism) |

Deleting the loser and thickening the winner conserves felsic mass exactly. Orogen
widening comes from gravitational collapse diffusion of `hFel` above `hCollapse` (50 km) in K8.

### 4.4 Transform boundaries

No mass exchange. `damage += kDamT · |relT| dt / vRef` on both owner columns (weak zones for
later rifting); orogenic ore rate on continental shear zones (§7).

## 5. Plate-level events (K0, CPU, cadence ~1 Myr)

**Split.** Per plate: cells whose owner `damage > 0.8` form corridors. If removing the corridor
cells disconnects the plate into ≥ 2 components of ≥ `minPlateCells` (40 at L5, scaled by
V/10,242), the smaller components become new plates: same `q` (body coordinates unchanged),
same `ω` initially, corridor cells assigned by nearest component. Corridor `damage` is set to
0.5 (remains a weak line). The force solve makes the halves diverge if the basal traction
under them differs — which is exactly where `ext` accumulated damage.

**Merge (suture).** Two plates merge when their shared boundary has been C–C CONVERGENT or
TRANSFORM with |relative speed| < `vSuture` (3 mm/yr) for > 20 Myr, or when a plate has fewer
than `minPlateCells/2` cells (absorbed into the neighbour with the longest shared boundary).
Columns are rebased: `b' = q_newᵀ q_old b`.

**Compaction.** Dead column slots are compacted by prefix sum; spawn slots are taken from the
free region by prefix sum over gap flags (deterministic order).

## 6. Dynamics

### 6.1 Mantle driver

```
Φ(r,t), Ψ(r,t) : 3–4 octaves of the existing plane-wave harmonics (dir, freq, phase),
                 degrees ~2–6, directions precessing with periods 200–500 Myr
u_mantle(r)    = U0 · Tm^2.5 · ( ∇ₛΦ + β · r × ∇ₛΨ )      β = 0.5, U0 = 5 cm/yr equivalent
plumes         : 3–6 Gaussian hot spots (radius ~500 km) fixed in the mantle frame,
                 lifetime 50–150 Myr, strength ∝ Tm; add a radial outflow term to u_mantle,
                 T_plume(r) to ext, zDyn swell (+1 km), hMaf and oMaf to columns above (LIP)
ext_i          = div(u_mantle − v_plate)_i  +  kPlume · T_plume(r_i)      (extension proxy)
```

The poloidal part `∇ₛΦ` has divergence (upwellings/downwellings); the toroidal part adds
shear. A pure `Σ A (a × r)` field would be a single rigid rotation and drive nothing (checked).

### 6.2 Rigid-plate force balance

Inertia is irrelevant on Myr scales: each plate moves at the angular velocity where basal drag
balances the other forces. With drag `F = c_D (u_mantle − v)` per unit area and all other
forces expressed as *equivalent basal velocities* `w` (their force divided by `c_D`), the
balance `Σ A r × (u + w − ω × r) = 0` gives the closed 3×3 system

```
M ω = b,   M = Σ_cells A_i (I − r_i r_iᵀ),   b = Σ_cells A_i r_i × (u_mantle,i + w_i) / R
ω_target = M⁻¹ b ;   ω ← ω + (ω_target − ω) · min(1, dt / τ_ω),  τ_ω = 0.5 Myr ;   |ω| R ≤ vMax
```

The shorter relaxation keeps changing boundary loads from looking viscous; the explicit
collision term remains the normal-speed damper rather than increasing basal drag globally.

(For a rigid mantle rotation `u = Ω × r` this returns `ω = Ω`; drag-only is the least-squares
fit of the plate's rotation to the flow beneath it.) Plates with < 3 cells add `ε I` to `M`.
Solved on the CPU (JS) or in a one-workgroup kernel (WebGPU) — the `ω` never needs to leave
the GPU for the simulation to proceed.

### 6.3 Equivalent-velocity contributions `w_i`

| force | where | `w_i` |
|---|---|---|
| slab pull | subducting-side boundary cell of a subduction edge | `+ vSlab · s(age) · n_ij`, `s = min(1, age/70 Myr)`, `vSlab ≈ 1e6 m/Myr / cD(Tm)` per boundary cell (a plate 20 cells wide gains ~5 cm/yr) |
| ridge push | oceanic cells (`hFel < 8 km`) | `− kRidge · ∇ₛz`, `kRidge ≈ 5e6 m/Myr` per unit slope (≈ 1–2 cm/yr across a 2 km / 1500 km slope) |
| collision resistance | both sides of a C–C convergent edge | `− vColl · max(0, −relN)/vRef · n_ij`, multiplied by a bounded factor that grows with continental `hFel`, using the previous frame's `relN` (explicit coupling is stable at τ_ω = 0.5 Myr) |
| plume push | cells under a plume | included in `u_mantle` |

Drag itself is inside `M`, so `c_D` only rescales the other terms: `cD(Tm) = exp(Ea·(1/Tm − 1))`,
`Ea = 3`. As the planet cools the asthenosphere stiffens, slab pull and ridge push produce less
speed, and eventually `|ω| → 0` (stagnant lid) with no switch in the code.

### 6.4 Cooling

```
Tm(t) = Tfloor + (1 − Tfloor) · exp(−t / τ_cool)      Tm = 1 today-equivalent at t = t_now
```

defaults `Tm(0) = 1.6` (hot start), `τ_cool = 2.5 Gyr`, `Tfloor = 0.35`. Quantities scaled by
`Tm`: mantle flow (`Tm^2.5`), `cD` (above), lithosphere strength `1/Tm` (damage growth,
split rate), `hMafNew`, arc production `kArc·Tm`, plume strength, ridge `oVms` rate.
Epochs emerge: many fast small plates and little felsic early; large plates and Wilson cycles
in the middle; frozen lid with erosion only at the end.

### 6.5 Damage and strength

```
strength = clamp( 0.3 + 0.7·smoothstep(hFel; 10 → 35 km) + 0.3·smoothstep(age; 20 → 200 Myr), 0.3, 1.3 ) / Tm
damage  += dt · ( kDam · max(0, ext)/extRef / strength  +  kDamT·|relT|/vRef  −  kHeal · damage )
```

Old thick continental interiors (cratons) are strong; young arcs, thinned margins and hot
planets are weak. Damage lives on the column, so weak lines travel with the plate.

## 7. Surface: isostasy, erosion, sediment

### 7.1 Elevation (Airy with a thermal-lithosphere term)

```
ρm = 3300, ρFel = 2750, ρMaf = 2950, ρSed = 2400
buoy   = hFel(ρm−ρFel)/ρm + hMaf(ρm−ρMaf)/ρm + hSed(ρm−ρSed)/ρm
ci     = smoothstep(hFel; 5 km → 20 km)                        continentality
therm  = mix( 350·sqrt(min(age, 80 Myr)),  zRoot, ci )         m
z      = zRef + buoy − therm + zDyn,     zRef = −3342 m, zRoot = 2091 m
```

Calibration points: 7 km mafic at age 0 → −2600 m, at 80 Myr → −5730 m (Parsons–Sclater);
35 km felsic → +400 m; 70 km felsic (collision) → +6200 m before collapse and erosion;
15 km felsic over 7 km mafic (rifted margin) → ≈ −1.5 km. Sea level is constant 0;
`wet = z < 0`. Eustasy is backlog.

`zDyn` relaxes: `zDyn ← zDyn · exp(−dt/τ_dyn)`, `τ_dyn = 10 Myr`; trench and plume effects
re-add each frame while they persist, and a flexural Laplacian
`zDyn += kFlex · dt · Σ_ring (zDyn_j − zDyn_i)` produces forelands beside orogens.

### 7.2 Gravitational collapse

`hFel_i += kCollapse · dt · Σ_ring (hFel_j − hFel_i)` only where `max(hFel_i, hFel_j) > hCollapse`
(50 km), symmetric flux over the ring → conserves mass, spreads plateaus, caps mountain height.

### 7.3 Erosion and sediment routing (per frame, per cell)

```
q_i      = max(0, z_i) / zKnee                                       height, in knee units
e_i      = kEro · max(0, z_i) · q_i² · (1 + 2·slope_i/slopeRef) · dt  removed from hSed, then hFel, then hMaf
m_i      = e_i  (mobile), mFel_i = felsic fraction of e_i, p_i = kPlacer·(oOro+oArc)·e_i
lo(i)    = lowest ring neighbour
route    : if z_lo < z_i − δ : all of m,mFel,p move to lo(i) (land) or 50 % (under water, turbidite pass-through)
deposit  : what stays → owner column hSed += m (isostasy responds next frame), oBas/oPla updated (§8)
```

The intake is quadratic in elevation around `zKnee` (9 km) rather than linear in it: a linear
rate eats 2–3 km shields as fast as it caps 30 km peaks, while `z·q²` leaves low relief alone
(~0.08× at 2.5 km) and bites hard on tall crust (~11× at 30 km), so a plateau is capped instead
of the whole world being planed. `kEro` is calibrated *at* the knee (z·q² = kEro·z there), so
the two are one degree of freedom: the knee is the law's scale, not an independent knob. Both
are release numbers (experiments/erosion-knee.js measures any candidate on the L5 1500 Myr
history); the user control is the Erosion × scale on the intake, never the knee.

One hop per frame (10–100 kyr) is far faster than any tectonic motion, so sediment reaches
basins within a few frames. Gather-form (each cell sums inflow from ring cells whose `lo` is
itself) keeps it deterministic.

## 8. Metallogeny (6 potentials on columns, saturating, `fert`-scaled)

No fluid transport at 10–50 km cells: source, discharge and trap fall in one or two cells, so
a potential is accumulated locally where the geologic factory operates, with a 1-cell blur at
extraction. Tectonics does the planetary transport (subduction → arc). All rates use
`(1 − o)` saturation and a slow decay `kDecay = 1/500 Myr`.

| potential | game resources | accumulates when | rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `oVms` | Cu-Zn-Pb-Ag (VMS) | at oceanic column birth | `kV · Tm · min(1, relN/vRef) · fert` |
| `oMaf` | Ni-Cu-PGE, Cr; diamonds if under old thick craton | plume above column; rift column with continental donors | `kM · plume · dt · fert`; `+kM2` at rift spawn |
| `oArc` | Cu-Mo-Au porphyry, epithermal Au | overriding arc cells (`trenchDist 1–2`) | `kA · Tm · |relN|/vRef · (1 + kRec·(oVms + oBas + hSed/1 km of the subducting column)) · fert` — recycling enrichment |
| `oOro` | vein Au, W, Li pegmatites | continental columns within 1 cell of a C–C convergent or continental transform edge, or `hFel > 45 km` | `kO · (|relN|+|relT|)/vRef · damage⁺ · fert` |
| `oBas` | U, coal / hydrocarbons, evaporites | sediment deposition into a submerged or low (`z < 300 m`) column | `kB · deposited · mFel + kB2 · dt · [hSed > 2 km ∧ wet]` |
| `oPla` | placer Au | deposition of mobile placer load `p` | `p` transferred with the sediment |

Fe is not stored: at extraction it is derived from exposed mafic crust (`hFel < 2 km`, `z > 0`,
high `oMaf`) and from `oBas` in old basins (BIF context).

**Extraction** (CPU, on demand): for each potential, local maxima of the 1-cell-blurred cell
field above a threshold, ranked, emitted as deposit nodes with a context tag (host crust,
depth, age, epoch) that the game maps to specific resources. The simulation core never needs
the extraction.

## 9. Initial states

- **Hot start** (acceptance runs): all columns oceanic (`hMaf = hMafNew(1.6)`, `age ~ U(0, 20)`),
  8–16 seed plates (Voronoi on random seeds), `ω` from the first force solve, `Tm = 1.6`,
  no continents. Felsic crust is produced only by arcs; continents emerge by arc accretion and
  collision.
- **Map start** (development): land mask of `Grid.build()` gives continental columns
  (`hFel = 35 km + 5·elev`, `age = 500`), ocean columns `hMaf = 7 km`, `age ~ U(0,120)`,
  `Tm = 1`.

## 10. Invariants, determinism, acceptance

Invariants tracked in K11: `Σ A0·hFel` (changes only by arc production, recorded),
`Σ A0·hMaf + subducted` (changes only by ridge/arc/plume production, recorded),
`Σ A0·hSed + mobile` (changes only by erosion↔deposition, i.e. total crust `hFel+hMaf+hSed`
+ subducted − produced = const), Σ ores per class, number of plates, mean and max |v|, gap and
overlap counts, NaN guard.

Determinism: CPU run is bit-reproducible from the seed. GPU run is reproducible on the same
device: the only scatter is the BIN counting sort, whose per-cell order is resolved by a total
order (distance, index); reductions run in a fixed two-level order.

Acceptance (all at L5 CPU unless noted; automated where possible, see `0.2-plan.md`):

1. Rigid transport: 30° cap, 5 cm/yr, 1000 Myr, dt 0.1 → IoU ≥ 0.95, zero interior gaps
   (bench already passes: 0.97).
2. Two prescribed plates converging at 5 cm/yr: subducted area per Myr = speed × trench length
   ± 10 %; ridge behind them spreads symmetrically (± 20 % of columns per side).
3. Hot start, 1500 Myr: continental area 15–40 %, cratons (`hFel > 30 km`, age > 300 Myr)
   exist, plate speeds 1–10 cm/yr in the middle epoch, ≤ 1 mm/yr after `Tm < 0.45`.
4. A Wilson cycle (split → ocean → closure → collision) occurs at least once in 1500 Myr.
5. Ore geography: > 60 % of `oArc` mass within 2 cells of a subduction edge (overriding side);
   `oVms` only on oceanic crust; `oOro` inside collision/transform belts; `oBas` in
   `hSed > 1 km` cells; `oPla` downslope of `oOro`/`oArc` maxima.
6. Stability: 4500 Myr at dt 0.1 and 500 Myr at dt 0.01 without NaN, with < 5 % of boundary
   edges changing type per frame and invariant drift < 1 % (excluding recorded sources/sinks).
